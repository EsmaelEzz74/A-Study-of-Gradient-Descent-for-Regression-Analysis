Exploring the Power of Machine Learning to Improve Data-Driven Decisions

8 Different Types of Gradient Descent Programmed form Scratch in OOP :

•For 8 different types of gradient descent algorithms.

•First I implement a superclass with all the common traits of all 8 algorithms types.

•The superclass contains some functions for plotting the cost function, thetas-0, thetas-1, all the predicted values,
and the fitted line for them.

•For each algorithm I Redesigned a child class that inherits the superclass to use the common traits then I added the
unique traits for each then I adjusted the optimizer function to calculate the specific algorithm.

•After each child class, I Generate sample data to demonstrate that the class still working properly. Then I print out
the R2 score for the algorithm and display its graphs to Clarify the point.
